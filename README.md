ME Esports Bot
Welcome to ME Esports, a powerful and interactive Discord bot designed to make managing esports scrims and tournaments easier than ever. Built with a modern, asynchronous core, ME provides a fast, responsive, and user-friendly dashboard for all your server's competitive gaming needs.

How It Works
ME is designed to be intuitive and powerful, handling the complex logistics of event management so you don't have to.

Interactive Scrim Management
At the heart of the bot is the central scrims dashboard, accessible with the msmanager command. From this single panel, you can:

Create New Scrims: An interactive wizard guides you through setting up a new scrim, allowing you to configure everything from the registration channel and time to recurring days and custom roles.

View Active Scrims: Get a clear, at-a-glance overview of all upcoming scrims in your server.

Edit Existing Scrims: A comprehensive editor allows you to modify every detail of a previously created scrim.

Seamless User Experience
Customization: Server administrators can set a custom command prefix to integrate the bot perfectly with their community.

Dynamic Help: A clean, embed-based help menu makes it easy for users to discover and learn commands.

Persistent Data: All your scrims and settings are permanently stored in a reliable PostgreSQL database, ensuring no data is lost when the bot restarts.
